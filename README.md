### What I learned

This project helped reinforce some things regarding my coding.
- I had to spend a decent amount of time testing the device across multiple devices to ensure compatibility
- I also had to spend more time with understanding flex box to get the layout of the site to cooperate. 
- An under the hood lesson, but I'm realizing I should not be pushing updates to the repository super often. There were times where things would break and I'd have to undo the change, repush it and test it again. Going forward unless I'm testing mobile device access git pushes will be more limited.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/#gsc.tab=0) - This site is amazing and can help so much when it comes to trying to remember how certain items work with HTML and CSS.
- I looked at a random person's submission for this challenge, and they gave me the idea to use a button for the learning text box.
